<h2>The Halloween Store</h2>

<h3>For the little Goblin in all of us!</h3>

<h1>Welcome to my site. Please come in and stay awhile.</h1>
<p>
I started this website because Halloween has always been my favorite holiday. But during the last year, I started selling some of my favorite Halloween products, and they've become quite a hit.
</p>

<p>
If you click on the Personal link, you can browse my favorite Halloween pictures, stories, and films. And if you join my email list, I will keep you up-to-date on all things Halloween.
